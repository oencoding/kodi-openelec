This episode focuses on King George V. George was an unlikely moderniser. Born and brought up in the Victorian age he was conservative to his fingertips. Yet in the face of unstoppable social change, he turned out to be a remarkable innovator, creating the House of Windsor, embracing democratic reform, and reinventing many of the royal traditions that we know today. When he celebrated his silver jubilee in 1935 the monarchy was more popular than ever. But as a parent King George V was far less successful - he bullied his children and alienated his eldest son and heir, Prince Edward.

This sound was nurtured by small independent labels and travelled up from the Mississippi corridor spawning new artists. In Memphis, Elvis began his career as a local singer with a country twang who rocked up a blues song and sounded so black he confused his white listeners. In St Louis, Chuck Berry took a country song and turned it into his first rock 'n' roll hit. Movies had a big role to play thanks to 'social problem' films exploring the teenager as misfit and delinquent - Blackboard Jungle gave them a soundtrack, with Rock Around the Clock becoming the first rock 'n' roll Number 1."}, {"start": 1454112000, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvprogramme/278849/30a56cbe896435620a3dfec1fa35705f.jpg", "end": 1454114400, "name": "Top of the Pops: 1981", "description": "Peter Powell introduces the pop programme, featuring Status Quo, Kim Wilde, Madness, Kelly Marie, Kiki Dee, Coast to Coast, the Passions, Beggar and Co, Roxy Music, Joe Dolce and Ultravox, and a dance performance from Legs and Co."}, {"start": 1454114400, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvprogramme/280985/4996190e7d6a594cb73cf26fddb4d150.jpg", "end": 1454118000, "name": "It's Only Rock 'N' Roll: Rock 'N' Roll at the BBC", "description": "A celebration of rock 'n' roll in the shape of a compilation of classic artists and songs, featuring the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion and Dick Dale who all featured in the Rock 'n' Roll America series, alongside songs that celebrate rock 'n roll itself from artists such as Tom Petty (Anything That's Rock 'n' Roll), Joan Jett (I Love Rock 'n' Roll) and Oasis (Rock 'n' Roll Star)."}, {"start": 1454118000, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvprogramme/280985/4996190e7d6a594cb73cf26fddb4d150.jpg", "end": 1454121600, "name": "Music Moguls: Masters of Pop: Myth Makers", "description": "Three-part series revealing the secret history of pop and rock from the men and women who pull the strings behind the scenes.

The sisters' lives changed forever after the birth of their little brother Alexei, whose life-threatening condition - haemophilia - meant that he became the main focus of their mother Alexandra's love and attention. Alexandra was obsessed with keeping Alexei's illness an absolute secret, so the family lived in a gilded cage; the girls seldom left the confines of their palace, had few friends and knew almost nothing of the outside world. One of the few outsiders to whom the four sisters became genuinely close was their parents' controversial spiritual advisor Rasputin."}, {"start": 1454274000, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvprogramme/984920/74799e17f73dfefb0b15eacd132f9ba5.jpg", "end": 1454277600, "name": "Tales From the Royal Bedchamber", "description": "Lucy Worsley gets into bed with our past monarchs to uncover the Tales from the Royal Bedchamber.

But as he tells his story, it gradually becomes clear that nothing is quite what it seems. This film is a stylistically daring experiment in storytelling, in effect a one-man play constructed from a four-day interview. In a monologue that is part confessional and part performance, Nick, the sole protagonist, tells a tale with all the twists and turns of classic crime drama. But as the story unfolds it reveals itself as something much deeper, an emotionally powerful meditation on the redemptive power of love and literature. A final shocking twist casts everything in a new light."}, {"start": 1454283000, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvprogramme/285044/a6d9af17860b3364f537ac8df7e36922.jpg", "end": 1454286600, "name": "Horizon: What is Reality?", "description": "There is a strange and mysterious world that surrounds us, a world largely hidden from our senses.

This episode explores how the brain gives rise to thoughts, emotions, memories and personality. We see how the process of becoming 'you' starts at birth. The brain of a newborn baby is not yet fully developed, but grows and shapes itself around life experience. Wiring up begins immediately, as the child's brain starts to adapt to whatever situation - culture, habitat, language - it's born into. This allows humans to flourish in any stimulating environment, but a lack of social contact and stimulation can result in permanent brain damage. Dr Eagleman tests the social stress levels of teenagers as their brains go through profound changes, meets London cabbies whose intense training to memorize street maps physically alters the shape of their hippocampus, and joins a group of elderly nuns who are defying the symptoms of Alzheimers by keeping their brains active and building up 'cognitive reserve'."}, {"start": 1454290200, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvprogramme/280985/4996190e7d6a594cb73cf26fddb4d150.jpg", "end": 1454293800, "name": "Rock 'N' Roll America: Sweet Little Sixteen", "description": "Series tracing the history of rock 'n' roll. In Cold War mid-1950s America, as the new suburbia was spreading fast in a country driven by racial segregation, rock 'n' roll took the country by surprise. Out of the Deep South came a rhythm-driven fusion of blues, boogie woogie and vocal harmony played by young black pioneers that seduced young white teens and got black and white kids rocking together. This sound was nurtured by small independent labels and travelled up from the Mississippi corridor spawning new artists. In Memphis, Elvis began his career as a local singer with a country twang who rocked up a blues song and sounded so black he confused his white listeners. In St Louis, Chuck Berry took a country song and turned it into his first rock 'n' roll hit. Movies had a big role to play thanks to 'social problem' films exploring the teenager as misfit and delinquent - Blackboard Jungle gave them a soundtrack, with Rock Around the Clock becoming the first rock 'n' roll Number 1."}, {"start": 1454293800, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvprogramme/631322/7f84bce5b78359107d9338395b57a0b7.jpg", "end": 1454295300, "name": "Sounds of the Eighties", "description": "Another in the series of 1980s pop archive shows highlights those bands that swayed on the spot, compulsory for the synthesiser bands that dominated the decade.
