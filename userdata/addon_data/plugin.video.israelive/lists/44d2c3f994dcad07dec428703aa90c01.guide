And all they need to fulfill their ambition is a guitar pick made from one of Satan's teeth. On this loose premise, Liam Lynch's comedy, written by Black and Gass, is an excuse for the two actors to indulge in every rock joke going. The film mixes their live act, with suitably outré lyrics, with set pieces including a car chase to rival The Dukes of Hazzard and a chance to see JB doing extraordinary push-ups. The supporting cast include Meatloaf as JB's disapproving father and, in cameos, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins and David Grohl of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters as the Devil himself."

The murder goes ahead but Neff's boss, Barton Keyes, has a niggling doubt about paying out on the policy, causing Walter and Phyllis's passion to slowly sour. Told in flashback through Neff's narrative, the hard-edged, cynical tone matched the mood of the period and, while the censorious Hays Code is followed to the letter, the glimpse of Phyllis's ankle bracelet was one of the era's enduring erotic images."

Tom Hansen is making a living writing soppy messages for greetings cards; it's not what he'd planned. But things start to look up when his boss hires a new secretary, the ethereally beautiful Summer Finn. Tom believes in true love and, when he first meets Summer, he's sure he's found 'the one'. Unfortunately, Summer couldn't be more cynical when it comes to romance. She and Tom gradually find they have more and more in common, but she repeatedly repels his amorous advances. And so Tom recounts in flashback, and in no particular order, the highs and lows of the 500 days during which he attempted to persuade her to ditch her scepticism and embrace love - with him.

Now, the war is deemed over; humans mostly continue to live within the walls, vampires have been banished to reservations, and Priests have had their authority to kill at will withdrawn. But, on learning that his niece has been abducted by vampires, one Priest abandons his obedience to The Church and sets out to either rescue her or, if she has been infected, kill her.

The film both plays it straight, purporting to be 'a presentation from a cultural and historical point of view in seven chapters of moving pictures' that thoroughly explores witchcraft, and also features, at times, lurid recreations of the events discussed in the intertitles. It's a real curiosity, and not only has it stood the test of time, but's also worth watching for its incredibly creative special effects, some of which were not bettered for decades."

His wife has been involved in a powerboating accident and now lies comatose and gravely ill in hospital. This should bring him closer to the daughters he's neglected: 10-year-old Scottie and 17-year-old Alex. He's a bit taken aback by their moodiness and foul-mouthed squabbles, and they're, initially, unconvinced by his belated interest in them. But then the girls reveal that they've been holding back a secret from him about their mother, which comes as both a shock and a catalyst for action to Matt."

Once sealed inside, they can be forgiven for thinking that they're safe. But it's not long before they find themselves under attack from military personnel of uncertain allegiance; they repel the incursion, but it exacts its price. Now they must face up to their claustrophobic entombment, with dwindling supplies and fellow captives whose moral compasses were vaporised when the first mushroom cloud appeared above the Big Apple. As the rivalries degenerate into primal violence and sexual depravity, it has to be asked whether survival was their best option."

Van Helsing is then dispatched to Transylvania, where his assignment is to assist Princess Anna Valerious in her long-standing quest to defeat Count Dracula.

But the undead nobleman awaits them, and he has forged an unlikely but deadly alliance with other supernaturals...

But that's exactly what ex-con Frankie and his smack-addicted Australian sidekick Russell do, at the behest of their boss, Johnny 'Squirrel' Amato. The game in question was organised by local gangster Markie, who was foolish enough to rob one of his own games in the past. To the victims of the robbery it's unclear who was responsible, but clearly someone must pay. Thus Mob middleman Driver hires hitman Jackie Cogan to solve the problem. Cogan's a cold killer, but he prefers not to kill people he knows and to murder his targets 'softly', without warning, so they don't experience fear. Unfortunately, out of misjudged pity, Cogan also subcontracts his old friend, the alcoholic, womanising Mickey to help him."

But Brighton, the henchman told to dispatch the princess, can't bring himself to fulfil his task and lets her go. And thus, deep in the forest, Snow White discovers a band of brigand dwarves who are only too happy to help her win the hand of her prince and depose her murderous stepmother. There are some violent scenes, but the general tone is humorous, and the acting at times plays second fiddle to the astonishing set and costume design."

In David Silverman's animated comedy, Homer rescues a pig from certain death, not realising that his actions will culminate in Springfield's isolation from the world. Through an impulsive act of environmental vandalism, Homer inadvertently causes pollution so toxic that it makes a squirrel mutate. When the government discovers what has happened, it's decreed that the town must be enclosed under a gargantuan glass dome to prevent the pollution from escaping to the rest of the country. Once trapped, the townsfolk, armed with torches and pitchforks, turn on the Simpsons. Will they escape the murderous mob? And if they do, what can Homer do to save Springfield?"

There, the idealistic CIA rookie Matt Weston is given responsibility for questioning Frost. However, the safe house in which they are based is violently attacked and the pair must flee for their lives. And, during the course of the ensuing relentless chase, Weston discovers that all is not as it first seemed."

It is 1560 and the great Spanish military explorer Gonzalo Pizarro has embarked on an expedition intended to make everyone involved rich beyond the bounds of avarice. However, from the start, as his cortège, containing priests and the noblemen's womenfolk as well as soldiers, winds its way from the Peruvian mountains down towards the Amazon, it's clear they drastically underestimated the difficulties ahead of them. But, as terra firma gives way to the mud, flood and disease of the jungle, Pizarro sees sense and halts, commanding Don Lope de Aguirre and a small band of men to continue the search."

Sadly, the Manassas Tigers' absolute lack of success on the field - they've not won a single game for ten years - gives neither the players nor the school much relief from the hardships that economic depression has visited upon their neighbourhood. The documentary focuses on three of the team's members - OC Brown, whose hopes of making it to college look faint; Montrail 'Money' Brown, who's struggling with injury problems; and Chavis Daniels, who has already fallen disastrously foul of the law - as well as volunteer coach Bill Courtney, whose relatively privileged life away from the field is glimpsed, in addition to his inspiring efforts to galvanise the team and provide a strong role model for the young men in his charge."

The movie was directed by Doo-Yong Lee, though persistent rumour claims that the movie was directed by Italian horror director Umberto Lenzi. (He may have directed the Bruceploitation elements that were tacked on to the original film.) The poster for the film bears a resemblance to the Meat Loaf album, Bat Out of Hell, but the film was released a year before the album's release date. The poster's artwork was very common among exploitation films."

He keeps getting into fights, even though his grandfather warns him not to show their Kong-Fu to others. Jackie, though, is tempted by some thugs he beat up to act as the master of a Kong-Fu school. This school's name apparently spreads far, as an old enemy of Jackie's grandfather (who turns out to be the master of an old gang or something equally obscure) shows up and kills him. Jackie goes on training with the help of another member of the old gang, until he can eventually get revenge."
