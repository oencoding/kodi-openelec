Dar Dar's group of four make a fifth Numtum by drawing a face on a balloon, but the balloon bursts and they are also turned away. Will the Numpups ever get in to see 'The Quest for the Hooded Paw'?"

The Bo Peep wolf plays a flute in order to lure a lamb into the clutches of his buddies (who provide jazz accompaniment). When that fails, the Bo Peep wolf plays a screaming hot trumpet and lures the lamb successfully. The lamb goes into the pot, but Mighty Mouse (in his treetop penthouse) hears a bleat.

Popeye immediately sails off to the West, where he finds, who else, Bluto as the head of the ranch where Olive is enthralled. Bluto gives Popeye a wild horse to ride, and, after a few humiliating defeats, Popeye conquers it (and wins back Olive's heart). Bluto punches Popeye out, and into the clutches of what can best be described as a rattlesnake constrictor. Bluto then starts menacing Olive, so Popeye eats his spinach, saves her, and defeats Bluto and his gang."

Of course, this wouldn't be a Gumby cartoon if Washington didn't proceed to send Pokey to Trenton as a spy so they can communicate via Walkie Talkie to see what's going on as they make their famous attack. Unfortunately, Pokey is captured by opposing soldiers, who, impressed by the novelty of a talking horse, take him before their general to be the army's mascot. Gumby chooses to call when Pokey's right in front of the general. Pokey tries his best to shut him up, but Gumby insists on saying everything he knows about what Washington's doing. Fortunately, the general doesn't believe a word he says. Gumby and Pokey proceed to do nothing useful whatsoever until the cartoon is over."

Although ANG is wary of the lone wolf being around his sister, ANG tries his best to work alongside K-Ho.  \r\n\r\nOnce inside the temple, which Chin recognizes as the Temple of Bastet, our heroes are not only pitted against the Emperor and his shape-shifting sister Yin-Wi, they're also confronted with the cat-headed goddess Bastet (who's under the Emperor's power) and her legion of mummified Cat Warriors.  Things get even more dangerous when Bastet transforms into her other form - a malevolent, bloodthirsty lioness!  \r\n\r\nOur heroes eventually defeat the Emperor by helping Bastet return to her formerly peaceful self.
