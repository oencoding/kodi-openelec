The heroin is being imported from Marseille by Alain Charnier, who is prepared to do anything, including murdering policemen, to get his narcotics out on the streets. But, although they know it's on its way, Doyle and Russo don't know how. And they make life more difficult for themselves by battling with FBI agent Mulderig, who's also working the case.
