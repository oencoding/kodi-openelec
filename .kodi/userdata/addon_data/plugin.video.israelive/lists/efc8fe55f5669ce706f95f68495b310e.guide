With partner Sian also working, the couple are lucky to spend one Sunday a month together with their son Cai. Fed up of feeling like a single parent, Sian is desperate for change - and though she has never been, she believes New Zealand could offer her family the lifestyle she dreams of. Josh, however, thinks Sian's head is firmly in the clouds and worries about leaving the security of the family's business. When a week living in Auckland shows him what life down under could offer, will it be enough to persuade him to follow Sian's dream and make the move?"

The latest science also reveals why budgies talk, how a cat scales a vertical wall with the help of a special claw, why hamsters stuff their faces with more food than they can eat and the real meaning behind a rabbit's hop. Plus the free-roaming pet dogs of Cusco Peru, pet rabbits living in a natural warren and the wild-living inhabitants of Cat Island, Japan. Moving X-rays, thermal imagery, minicam-carrying dogs and slow-motion photography show why pets play and how their true wild nature is just a whisker away."

Mum Vicky has suffered from ME - or chronic fatigue syndrome - for years, but her condition deteriorated dramatically six years ago. As a result, husband Gavin has been left to juggle work with looking after the couple's children. Now Vicky is desperate to get her life back and become the mum she dreams of being. Doctors have told her living in a warmer climate than the UK's could improve her health, leading the family to investigate moving to Australia. With none of the family having visited before, however, Gavin feels it is just too big a leap. The O'Connors spend a week living in Adelaide to see if Gavin's work and financial concerns can be addressed - and if the country could give Vicky her independence back."

With the help of bird experts Professor Graham Martin and Steven Portugal, Lucy sets up a range of tests and GPS tagging to discover exactly what makes the seagulls such good thieves. Lucy also goes to Rustington in Sussex, where she discovers that the fox population is increasing dramatically. She sets up a test to discover whether foxes choose jam sandwiches and sausage rolls or the more natural diet of worms and fruit. With numbers of urban gulls up to around 250,000 in the UK and urban foxes and badgers on the increase, Lucy concludes that the phenomenon of seagulls, badgers, foxes and squirrels living in our towns and stealing our food is here to stay."

With partner Sian also working, the couple are lucky to spend one Sunday a month together with their son Cai. Fed up of feeling like a single parent, Sian is desperate for change - and though she has never been, she believes New Zealand could offer her family the lifestyle she dreams of. Josh, however, thinks Sian's head is firmly in the clouds and worries about leaving the security of the family's business. When a week living in Auckland shows him what life down under could offer, will it be enough to persuade him to follow Sian's dream and make the move?"

The latest science also reveals why budgies talk, how a cat scales a vertical wall with the help of a special claw, why hamsters stuff their faces with more food than they can eat and the real meaning behind a rabbit's hop. Plus the free-roaming pet dogs of Cusco Peru, pet rabbits living in a natural warren and the wild-living inhabitants of Cat Island, Japan. Moving X-rays, thermal imagery, minicam-carrying dogs and slow-motion photography show why pets play and how their true wild nature is just a whisker away."

Mum Vicky has suffered from ME - or chronic fatigue syndrome - for years, but her condition deteriorated dramatically six years ago. As a result, husband Gavin has been left to juggle work with looking after the couple's children. Now Vicky is desperate to get her life back and become the mum she dreams of being. Doctors have told her living in a warmer climate than the UK's could improve her health, leading the family to investigate moving to Australia. With none of the family having visited before, however, Gavin feels it is just too big a leap. The O'Connors spend a week living in Adelaide to see if Gavin's work and financial concerns can be addressed - and if the country could give Vicky her independence back."

With the help of bird experts Professor Graham Martin and Steven Portugal, Lucy sets up a range of tests and GPS tagging to discover exactly what makes the seagulls such good thieves. Lucy also goes to Rustington in Sussex, where she discovers that the fox population is increasing dramatically. She sets up a test to discover whether foxes choose jam sandwiches and sausage rolls or the more natural diet of worms and fruit. With numbers of urban gulls up to around 250,000 in the UK and urban foxes and badgers on the increase, Lucy concludes that the phenomenon of seagulls, badgers, foxes and squirrels living in our towns and stealing our food is here to stay."

With partner Sian also working, the couple are lucky to spend one Sunday a month together with their son Cai. Fed up of feeling like a single parent, Sian is desperate for change - and though she has never been, she believes New Zealand could offer her family the lifestyle she dreams of. Josh, however, thinks Sian's head is firmly in the clouds and worries about leaving the security of the family's business. When a week living in Auckland shows him what life down under could offer, will it be enough to persuade him to follow Sian's dream and make the move?"

Featuring views of plunge-diving dogs, babysitting cats, acrobatic hamsters and a playful cat outwitted by his prey. The latest science also reveals why budgies talk, how a cat scales a vertical wall with the help of a special claw, why hamsters stuff their faces with more food than they can eat and the real meaning behind a rabbit's hop.

Mum Vicky has suffered from ME - or chronic fatigue syndrome - for years, but her condition deteriorated dramatically six years ago. As a result, husband Gavin has been left to juggle work with looking after the couple's children. Now Vicky is desperate to get her life back and become the mum she dreams of being. Doctors have told her living in a warmer climate than the UK's could improve her health, leading the family to investigate moving to Australia. With none of the family having visited before, however, Gavin feels it is just too big a leap. The O'Connors spend a week living in Adelaide to see if Gavin's work and financial concerns can be addressed - and if the country could give Vicky her independence back."

One year on, Fraja's cancer is now in remission, and the family are desperate to put the heartache of the last year behind them and make a fresh start down under.

With partner Sian also working, the couple are lucky to spend one Sunday a month together with their son Cai. Fed up of feeling like a single parent, Sian is desperate for change - and though she has never been, she believes New Zealand could offer her family the lifestyle she dreams of. Josh, however, thinks Sian's head is firmly in the clouds and worries about leaving the security of the family's business. When a week living in Auckland shows him what life down under could offer, will it be enough to persuade him to follow Sian's dream and make the move?"

        "description": "First of a two-part documentary using innovative techniques to reveal the secrets of pets' behaviour, including why hamsters love to run in a wheel, how dogs pick up the rules of the pack and how kittens learn to be solitary hunters. Featuring views of plunge-diving dogs, babysitting cats, acrobatic hamsters and a playful cat outwitted by his prey. The latest science also reveals why budgies talk, how a cat scales a vertical wall with the help of a special claw, why hamsters stuff their faces with more food than they can eat and the real meaning behind a rabbit's hop. Plus the free-roaming pet dogs of Cusco Peru, pet rabbits living in a natural warren and the wild-living inhabitants of Cat Island, Japan. Moving X-rays, thermal imagery, minicam-carrying dogs and slow-motion photography show why pets play and how their true wild nature is just a whisker away."

Mum Vicky has suffered from ME - or chronic fatigue syndrome - for years, but her condition deteriorated dramatically six years ago. As a result, husband Gavin has been left to juggle work with looking after the couple's children. Now Vicky is desperate to get her life back and become the mum she dreams of being. Doctors have told her living in a warmer climate than the UK's could improve her health, leading the family to investigate moving to Australia. With none of the family having visited before, however, Gavin feels it is just too big a leap. The O'Connors spend a week living in Adelaide to see if Gavin's work and financial concerns can be addressed - and if the country could give Vicky her independence back."

With the help of bird experts Professor Graham Martin and Steven Portugal, Lucy sets up a range of tests and GPS tagging to discover exactly what makes the seagulls such good thieves. Lucy also goes to Rustington in Sussex, where she discovers that the fox population is increasing dramatically. She sets up a test to discover whether foxes choose jam sandwiches and sausage rolls or the more natural diet of worms and fruit. With numbers of urban gulls up to around 250,000 in the UK and urban foxes and badgers on the increase, Lucy concludes that the phenomenon of seagulls, badgers, foxes and squirrels living in our towns and stealing our food is here to stay."

Filming at his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, their production becomes the world's first ever global TV documentary series, the first time the horror of the camps has been heard directly from the mouths of its victims. Edited daily and broadcast in Germany, America, Israel and 34 other countries, people fainted when they saw it on TV.

This charity fights to prevent male suicide - which is now the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in England and Wales. Professor Green became a supporter of CALM in the wake of his own father's suicide, an experience he talks about in the programme. The film also features the story of Hector Stringer. To everyone around him, Hector was a gifted musician with everything to live for. But like many young men he found it hard to open up about things that were troubling him. Aged just 18, he took his own life. His family and best friend Mario talk about the terrible impact it has had on them. They believe CALM's helpline, webchat service, website and magazine provide a crucial service in preventing similar needless deaths."

Thomas Cromwell's patron, Cardinal Wolsey, is dismissed as lord chancellor and forced to flee his palace at York Place. The old noble families of England, jealous of their own right to advise the king, have long waited for this moment. His hopes of returning to the king's favour lie with the ever-loyal Thomas Cromwell. Still lacking a male heir, the king is desperate for an annulment from his marriage to Katherine of Aragon but the cardinal's efforts to persuade the Pope to grant the annulment are fruitless. As Henry grows impatient, the pressure increases on the cardinal. To add to this, rumours reach the cardinal that the king's new mistress is Anne Boleyn, who has sworn vengeance on him over Harry Percy. Cromwell visits Anne, but she is unmoved. A desperate Cromwell finally meets directly with Henry, but the king is nothing if not ambiguous. Will he recall the cardinal, or turn on him?"

Speaking directly to camera and accompanied by extensive archive footage, he relives his past and draws on intense memories to navigate the extraordinary adventure of his early life. Freddie's story is a dramatic - and often surprisingly funny - real-life account. His story travels from his family life in 1930s Vienna through the German occupation of Austria and his flight to Belgium. Then onto Nazi-occupied Paris, where Freddie lived and worked in red-light Pigalle, entertaining German officers and socialising with dancing girls, before an interrogation by the Gestapo meant he had to move on again. After a brief spell in the Resistance, the war eventually caught up with him and his life in Auschwitz began."

Richard Hammond is on the shores of Lake Como testing the exciting new Alfa Romeo 4C, a mid-engined machine from one of the world's most beloved sports car makers. Hammond's enjoyment of the super-lightweight, 237-horsepower beauty is brought to a halt by the arrival of Jeremy Clarkson on a quad bike, demanding a race to the far end of the vast lake. Elsewhere in the programme, Clarkson is in the genteel surroundings of Bruges, and at the rather less sedate Spa Grand Prix track in order to test a thrilling new breed of hybrid hypercar: the stunning 904-horsepower McLaren P1. Meanwhile, James May is at the vast Camp Bastion in Afghanistan looking at the incredible efforts behind the army's largest vehicle redeployment since the Second World War. Finally, actor Tom Hiddleston tries his hand out on the track as the Star in the Reasonably Priced Car."

All its students have been permanently excluded or subjected to a managed move from schools across west London, many for behaviour issues. Staff are trained to deal with all sorts of challenging behaviour, but Bridge students are still expected to succeed academically. Jess was excluded from her previous school for disruptive behaviour which started following the break-up of her family, but is capable of getting good GCSEs if she can get her emotions under control. Millie had left two previous schools for verbally abusing teachers, but we discover another side of her as we learn she has suffered personal tragedy."

Tackling the sentimental tourist industry of Salzburg and the cloying reverence in which Mozart is too often held, Service visits the key cities and rooms in which Mozart lived and worked, plays some of Mozart's original instruments and scores, and gradually uncovers the brilliance and originality of his work as the 18th century turns into the 19th. Even more than the music, Mozart's tragic demise sets the seal on his myth. The trajectory of his life sets the template for the romantic paradigm whose throes we are still in today, which requires our creative heroes to die young to prove that they were too good for this madding world, whether it be Mozart or Jimi Hendrix. Service travels from London to Vienna and Salzburg, unpicking the living, breathing genius that was Mozart. With Sir John Eliot Gardiner, Nicola Benedetti, Paul Morley and others."

The Spanish conquest of the Inca destroyed one of the most remarkable empires in the world, yet the Inca legacy leaves a great deal for modern civilisations to learn from."

The film features contributions from Sir Richard Branson, Danny Boyle, Mike's family and the album's engineers, plus an extended interview with Mike himself, where he takes us through the events that led to him writing Tubular Bells - growing up with a mother with mental health problems, the refuge he sought in music as a child and his frightening experience of taking LSD at 16. After the album's huge success, Mike shunned public life and became a recluse until he took part in a controversial therapy which changed his life. Filmed on location at his home recording studio in Nassau, Mike also shows how Tubular Bells was put together."

Lucy looks at some of the most remarkable women of the age, including writers, actresses, travellers and scientists. Against a backdrop of religious and political turmoil, the rise of print culture, the rapid growth of London, the burgeoning scientific revolution and the country's flourishing trading empire, she meets a host of female mavericks who took advantage of the extraordinary changes afoot to challenge the traditional male bastions of society. Women like Nell Gwyn, the most famous of a new generation of actresses; Aphra Behn, the first professional female writer; and Christian Davies, who disguised herself as a man to fight as a soldier - all of them gained notoriety and celebrity, challenging the inequalities of the age. As Lucy discovers, these women's attitudes, ambitions and achievements were surprisingly modern."

An era in which the newly emergent middle classes had, for the first time, money for luxuries and early consumer goods, many of which contained hidden dangers. The period also saw a radical evolution in the very idea of 'home'. For the likes of Tudor merchants, their houses became multi-room structures instead of the single-room habitations that had been the norm.

The programme features the artists themselves, alongside people like Bill Haley's original Comets, the Crickets, Buddy Holly's widow Maria Elena, Jerry Lee Lewis's former wife Myra Gail and his sister, Chuck Berry's son and many more. Other contributors include Tom Jones, Jamie Callum, Paul McCartney, Cliff Richard, Joe Brown, Marty Wilde, Green Day, Minnie Driver, Jack White, the Mavericks, Jools Holland, Hank Marvin, Fontella Bass, John Waters and more. Elvis's pelvis was just the start. Who had to change the lyrics to their biggest hit because the originals were too obscene? Who married their 13-year-old cousin? Who used lard to get their hair just right? And what happened on the day the music died?"

Known as 'Indiana Jones with a notepad', he is a legend among his peers, a man who has been looking for the truths of human experience in the most dangerous places. Film-maker Gabrielle Pfeiffer travelled with Kapuscinski to four countries, capturing his true character, his passion, his humour and his demons. Her film unfolds in an engaging episodic format, in which the echoes of Kapuscinski's childhood as a war refugee interweave with his later experiences on the battlefields of the third world, in a poetic reverie of the tragedy and the absurdity of war."

Inspired by Indian spiritual master Meher Baba, Pete Townshend created the character of Tommy, the 'deaf, dumb and blind boy'. Broke and fragmenting when they started recording, the album went on to sell over 20 million copies. In this film, the Who speak for the first time about the making of the iconic album and how its success changed their lives."

This is the story of the men and women who chase earthquakes and try to understand this mysterious force of nature. Journeying to China's Sichuan Province, which still lies devastated by the earthquake that struck in May 2008, as well as the notorious San Andreas Fault in California, Horizon asks why science has so far fallen short of answering this fundamental question."

Alongside this well-known image of Victoria as the weeping widow, Wilson reveals that the years after Albert's death were actually a process of liberation and her most productive and exciting. By examining her closest relationships in the four decades after Albert's death, Wilson tells the story of the Queen's gradual freedom from a life spent under the shadow of domineering men. Victoria's marriage had been a source of constraint as well as love, as Albert had used her pregnancies as a way to gain power and punished her for resenting it. But in her widowhood Queen Victoria, although bereft and deranged, was free to move in the world of politics and make deep friendships without concern. Victoria's journals and letters are read by Anna Chancellor."

It was an age of exploration and science where adventurers returned from the New World with exotic goods previously unknown in Europe. An era in which the newly emergent middle classes had, for the first time, money for luxuries and early consumer goods, many of which contained hidden dangers. The period also saw a radical evolution in the very idea of 'home'. For the likes of Tudor merchants, their houses became multi-room structures instead of the single-room habitations that had been the norm. This forced the homebuilders of the day to engineer radical new design solutions and technologies, some of which were lethal. Suzannah discovers that in Tudor houses the threat of a grisly, unpleasant death was never far away in a world (and a home) still mired in the grime and filth of the medieval period - and she shows how we still live with the legacy of some of these killers today."

Even more than the music, Mozart's tragic demise sets the seal on his myth. The trajectory of his life sets the template for the romantic paradigm whose throes we are still in today, which requires our creative heroes to die young to prove that they were too good for this madding world, whether it be Mozart or Jimi Hendrix. Service travels from London to Vienna and Salzburg, unpicking the living, breathing genius that was Mozart. With Sir John Eliot Gardiner, Nicola Benedetti, Paul Morley and others."

More than anywhere, the Serengeti is synonymous with wilderness and has even come to represent Africa. But the story of the Serengeti is just as much about humans as it is about wildlife. Right from the origin of our species in Africa, humans have been profoundly shaping this unique wilderness - hunters and pastoralists with cattle and fire, ivory traders and big game hunters, conservationists, scientists, film-makers and even tourists have all played a part in shaping the Serengeti. Probably most powerful of all was a tiny microbe unknowingly brought to Africa by a small Italian expeditionary force - Rinderpest, a deadly virus that swept through the continent decimating cattle and wildlife alike and forever changing the face of the wild. The Serengeti is far from timeless, it is forever changing - and wherever there is change, the influence of Homo sapiens is not far behind."

He shows that all this was made possible by the discovery of magnetic tape by an American soldier in the ruins of WWII Germany, the invention that, more than any other, drove the emergence of the music studio as a compositional tool and the rise of the producer as a new creative force shaping the sound of song."

The results are captured in this programme, presented by Stuart Maconie.

Here they are raising an eight-month-old orphaned rhinoceros called Olive, whose mother was killed by poachers - 1,000 rhinos are killed for their horns every year. At Na'ankuse, a wildlife sanctuary in Namibia, Paul meets the owner Marlice, who introduces him to some of the resident animals - including a ten-month-old aardvark called Parkie, the strangest creature Paul has ever seen. He also meets Shrinky, a baby baboon who staff member Colette is caring for around the clock. Shrinky arrived in a terrible state, wounded and scarred, and Colette fears she might be brain damaged and have a serious problem with her sight. Finally, Paul has to serve ice lollies made of antelope blood to a lion cub called Nala."

This undercover investigation reveals how the vulnerable are exploited by criminals who draw them into a murky underworld of fake passports, false visas, and illegal employment.

At Na'ankuse, a wildlife sanctuary in Namibia, Paul meets the owner Marlice, who introduces him to some of the resident animals - including a ten-month-old aardvark called Parkie, the strangest creature Paul has ever seen. He also meets Shrinky, a baby baboon who staff member Colette is caring for around the clock. Shrinky arrived in a terrible state, wounded and scarred, and Colette fears she might be brain damaged and have a serious problem with her sight. Finally, Paul has to serve ice lollies made of antelope blood to a lion cub called Nala."

France was collapsing, the Nazis had the allies on the run, the British Army was being defeated at Dunkirk and Britain faced invasion. No one knew if Churchill was up to the task and the country's fate hung in the balance. Through two battles, three months and four great speeches, Churchill mastered his own demons and changed Britain forever by convincing the nation to fight on."

However, their room's hot tub still works, so they jump in, and discover to their surprise that the fancy bath is in fact a time machine. So, instead of reminiscing about their youth, they get the chance to relive it, as they're transported back to 1986."

The SGC is stunned to discover that Graham is a Zatarc, the victim of Goa'uld mind control technology. According to Anise, its victims are subconsciously programmed to kill, their recollection of the procedure covered by false memories. Anyone who has come into contact with the Goa'uld could well be a Zatarc - and wholly unaware of the fact. Through the use of an experimental testing device designed by the Tok'ra, Anise sets out to determine who, at the SGC, has been programmed. The test proves successful in uncovering a second Zatarc. But subsequent testing uncovers false memories in two more members of the SGC: Colonel Jack O'Neill and Major Samantha Carter."

As solar flares flash from the red sun overhead, Malikai warns Daniel that the geomagnetic disturbance may be dangerous to the SG-1 team and tells him to leave. When Daniel ignores him, Malikai zaps him with a weapon and begins to program the alien computer. O'Neill and Teal'c rush to Daniel's aid and are caught, with Malikai, in a mysterious blue light. Suddenly, they find themselves back at Stargate command, ten hours earlier, preparing to head off on the mission they've just returned from. And then it happens again. And again. And again. As O'Neill returns to eat the same bowl of cereal over and over again, it becomes clear that they've been caught in a time loop and that only he and Teal'c retain their memories through each ten-hour cycle. It's up to them to decode the message on the mysterious machine and figure out a way to break the loop."

When the Stargate won't open, trapping teams offworld, the SG-1 team investigates and learns that the Russians have their own Stargate. Their Stargate, apparently recovered from the sea after an Asguard ship crashed on earth, is locked open, maintaining a perpetual wormhole that defies explanation. At the request of Russian scientist Dr. Svetlana Markov, the SG-1 team is dispatched to the Russian stargate facility, where they make a shocking discovery. All the soldiers and scientists are dead and the Stargate remains locked open, connected to a water-covered planet. Svetlana explains that the Russians had retrieved a sample of the water, and found it has amazing properties, including the ability to emit significant levels of energy. That same water, however, seems to have disabled the drone, leaving it inoperable and sending transmissions that are keeping the gate open. Daniel, Carter and Svetlana head through the wormhole in a miniature submarine in an attempt to recover the drone. The water brings the sub to a halt and begins to crush it, leaving the team unable to return through the Stargate. Meanwhile, back at the Russian facility, O'Neill and Teal'c make their own shocking discovery. Inside a freezer is the frozen body of Col. Maybourne, a SG-1 turncoat who has apparently been advising the Russians. As he begins to thaw, he comes back to life, spewing out gallons of water and a terrified warning. It looks like water but is it water?"

Before he can bring back his sample however, his team is attacked by an Unas. One team member is killed and Daniel is dragged off into the wilderness by the giant primitive creature. Learning of Daniel's disappearance, O'Neill leads a rescue mission to the planet. Upon his arrival, he discovers that SG-11 has been almost wiped out - only Hawkins survived - and the planet's water supply is teeming with Goa'uld symbiotes. While O'Neill and Teal'c struggle with the possibility that one of their men may have been inhabited by a Goa'uld, Daniel is dragged further into the wilderness by his captor. Gradually, he begins to understand a few words of the creature's language. The Unas, a juvenile whose name seems to be Chaka, saves Daniel's life when he's attacked by a symbiote. As the rescue team struggles to catch up, however, the question remains: has Daniel become the Unas' newest friend or is he simply being brought home for dinner?"

One of their villages is attacked by a mysterious ship. The Enkarans seem to be facing a threat even more formidable than the Goa'uld. But when SG-1 investigates, they discover that the mystery ship has no hostile intent. It is merely terraforming the planet in order to make it habitable for the Gadmeer, a long-dormant alien species. Lotan, a bio-mechanical liaison created by the ship, explains that once the terraforming procedure has begun, it cannot be halted. To do so would mean extinction for the Gadmeer. On the other hand, a completion of the terraforming process would mean certain death for the Enkarans. SG-1 must find a solution to this ethical dilemma, or face the extinction of an entire race."

Back at the SGC, meanwhile, General Hammond is faced with the possibility that SG-1 perished on the planet's icy surface, a possibility he refuses to accept. As the General tries to unravel the team's mysterious disappearance, the members of SG-1 grasp at fleeting memories of their former lives, memories which are not just the keys to their freedom, but to their very survival."

He sounds like a crackpot, someone hardly worthy of their attention, that is until he mentions the Stargate. Hammond wants to play it safe. They need to check this guy out. O'Neill meets with the mystery caller, a nebbish fellow named Martin Lloyd who insists he is an alien and in possession of a space ship (who's location slips his mind at the moment). O'Neill is ready to dismiss Martin as a harmless nutjob and head back to Cheyenne Mountain, however, a series of strange occurrences begin to suggest that maybe, just maybe, there could be some truth to his story."

As the X-301 streaks through space at a million miles an hour, the SGC struggles to find a way to retrieve it. But after an attempt to alter the aircraft's course fails, things look grim. Daniel Jackson seeks the help of off-world allies. He learns that the Tok'ra have a ship capable of reaching O'Neill and Teal'c, but it is on a covert mission in Goa'uld-controlled territory. With time ticking down and the lives of their comrades hanging in the balance, Carter and Daniel must locate the Tok'ra ship, intercept the X-301, and pull off a daring rescue."

But as he reacquaints himself with his former colleagues, he begins to suspect that Dr. Jordan's death may not have been an accident. He discovers that one of the items the professor was studying, an ancient Egyptian jar, contains a perfectly preserved Goa'uld symbiote. Apparently, a crack in the vessel compromised the sedative solution within, killing the creature. But further investigation reveals a second jar may have existed. With a Goa'uld apparently stalking the campus and the local community abuzz with talk of an ancient curse, Daniel must unravel the mystery before it's too late."

He is spending his remaining time in the forest with his sister-in-law, cousin and carer. There, amid the profound natural beauty and incessant insect noise, all sorts of supernatural occurrences seem possible; indeed, the group is visited by both the ghost of Boonmee's dead wife and by his long-lost son, the latter now taking the form of a giant monkey spirit. The film unhurriedly offers its meditations on death, memory and remembrance - as well as touching on politics and including humorous asides - and was awarded the prestigious Palme d'Or at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival."

This powerful, candid and disturbing documentary explores the growing number of far-right splinter groups that have emerged.

Police in Luton have arrested a man and a woman from Hungary on suspicion of human trafficking. The case will be investigated by DC Tom Stean in the Serious Crime Unit, who discovers that both his suspects are already wanted under European Arrest Warrants for other alleged offences. It is no surprise to him: 'Human trafficking is getting worse and worse. I think Luton is a magnet.' Meanwhile, two alleged victims come forward to testify against the suspects in custody. As the detectives struggle to untangle lurid claim and counterclaim, a police forensic search team gains entry to the suspects' home.

Meanwhile, the average British driver spends more than 32 hours every year in gridlock. But spare a thought for Bristol's drivers, condemned to travel on the roads branded England's worst in a recent survey. This documentary follows Bristol City Council as they try to do something about it, with unique access to a state-of-the-art CCTV Control Centre staffed by 'traffic engineers' and covert traffic wardens. The programme reveals what happens when the city's new Mayor, renowned architect George Ferguson, attempts controversial reforms that put him on a collision course with the city's drivers."

Charlotte and her husband James have been together for nine years: 'I loved her from the moment I saw her to this moment right now,' says James. They have been married for a year and fell pregnant quickly, even though Charlotte has polycystic ovaries. Charlotte is very passionate about her job and hopes that her own birth experience will help her care more sensitively for women in childbirth. At 35, Julie Reid is 10 years older than her partner Nick and she has two children, aged 11 and 14, from a previous relationship. She says she didn't want more children herself, but agreed to have 'just one more' because Nick kept pestering her for a child of their own."

Unfortunately Steve isn't so smitten - and Mary's unnerving intensity, strange ways and garish dress sense result in him beating a hasty retreat. However, now that she's met 'her man' she's determined not to let him get away so easily. And when her public declaration of love, via the medium of her newspaper's crossword, gets her sacked, she knows exactly what to do with her unexpected free time. But stalking her prey only serves to spectacularly undermine the news reports he and his reporter Hartman are trying to make, initiating a frantic 'catch me if you can' chase across the country as she tries to change his mind and he becomes ever keener to stay one step ahead of her."

In May 1940, while covering the retreat from Dunkirk, a Mark 1 Spitfire flown by RAF ace Squadron Leader Geoffrey Stephenson was shot down and crash-landed on a beach in northern France, where it slowly sank into the sand. The wreckage was finally recovered in the 1980s and stored anonymously in France for more than 20 years. In this special documentary, Guy Martin - speed junkie, motorcycle racer, lorry mechanic and Spitfire fanatic - joins a restoration team as it embarks on a two-year rebuild of this Spitfire. This extraordinary project provides a look at the amazing engineering and skills involved in building the aircraft, and is also a fitting homage to the bravery of everyone involved in its service: the male and female factory workers, the ground crews and the pilots."

        "description": "A powerful documentary about the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps and how combat and newsreel cameramen filmed the almost unbelievable scenes they found there. When Allied forces liberated the Nazi concentration camps in 1944-45, their terrible discoveries revealed for the first time the full horror of what had happened. Making use of British, Soviet and American footage, the Ministry of Information's Sidney Bernstein aimed to create a documentary that would provide lasting, undeniable evidence of the Nazis' unspeakable crimes. He commissioned a wealth of British talent, including his friend Alfred Hitchcock. There were even secret talks with Hollywood director Billy Wilder, himself an Austrian refugee from the Nazis. But despite initial support from the British and US governments, the film was shelved. It was considered too sensitive for the rapidly changing political climate."

Veteran railroad employee Frank Barnes has his quarrels with the new guy on the job, Will Colson, largely because the younger man is about to replace him. But they must join forces and race against time when an enormous runaway train carrying toxic chemicals heads their way. If its terminal destination in a city wasn't bad enough, the lethal behemoth is also on the same line as another train carrying 150 children home from a school trip. When the railroad company's chairman refuses to take action for financial reasons, Frank takes it upon himself to save the day, despite the seemingly suicidal nature of the mission and the devastating consequences it's likely to have for his loved ones. Will opposes Frank's ridiculously dangerous idea, but joins him anyway. Can the two men patch up their differences and save the day?"

But this isn't a holiday: Mia is addicted to heroin and their removal from civilisation is intended to support Mia's attempt to go cold turkey and kick her habit. Unfortunately, they seem oblivious to the building's dark past, as well as the seriousness of the warnings scrawled in the mysterious book they find in the fetid cellar. So, when Mia starts acting strangely, they put her visions of demons down to withdrawal symptoms. But soon they're all party to the terrifying apparitions, and then come the horrific acts of self-mutilation, demonic possession and ever-spiralling gory violence."

They dream of giving the old industrial property a light, modern interior - but they've certainly got their work cut out. The mill had been deserted for four years and is in quite a state, but the couple aren't intimidated by the task ahead. The build has been organised like a military operation, their filing system has left nothing to chance and Chris will even be doing some of the work himself. But when the time comes to put paper theory into practice, will their dream home turn out quite how they expected?"

They want to build an earth-sheltered home from recycled materials, based on ideas pioneered in the 1970s in New Mexico. But land prices and planning laws have forced them out of England, across the Channel to Brittany. Constructed mainly from old car tyres, theirs is a very low-tech house requiring lots of low-tech energy to build it. To keep costs down, Daren and Adi enlist a bunch of unskilled volunteers to help them, in exchange for teaching them the techniques. It's all very admirable, but with the main components of this build being rubbish and mud, what will the house end up looking like? Presented by Kevin McCloud."

Everyone knows Winston Churchill led Britain and her allies in their struggle against Hitler; less well known is John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, who led Britain and her allies against an earlier would-be dictator of Europe: the Sun King, Louis XIV of France. John Churchill was both Winston's ancestor and his inspiration. Before he was Prime Minister, Winston was a writer and historian, and perhaps his greatest work is his million-word biography of John Churchill, Marlborough: His Life and Times, published in four volumes between 1933 and 1938. This first programme, The Choice, recounts how Winston came to write Marlborough."

Winston was a writer and historian before he was Prime Minister, and perhaps his greatest work is his million-word biography of John Churchill, Marlborough: His Life and Times. As David Starkey argues, the ten years Winston spent working on Marlborough turned him from a politician into a statesman-prophet, and prepared him for the immense task of leading the nation against Nazi Germany. In the second programme in the series, Starkey shows how Marlborough - which was also serialised in The Sunday Times - changed the way Winston was seen by the public and politicians, and so prepared the way for his return to power."
