A série decorre à volta da história de Alípio Abranhos, homem de genealogia meio confusa - algo entre relações adulteras e a roda das crianças abandonadas de um convento de Penafiel-, bacharel em direito que adquire a titulariedade de conde. A acção passa-se no séc. XIX, exactamente em 1871, na ressaca das Conferências do Casino e no momento em que José Fontana, Azedo Gneco, Antero de Quental e outros lançam as bases da Fraternidade Operária, semeando as ideias republicanas, socialistas e operárias que resultavam das várias soluções políticas que se ensaiavam por toda a Europa. Face a este vento de modernidade, Alípio Abranhos emerge como um hesitante, alguém que se afasta deste debate por razões de mero cálculo político e social. O seu objectivo é claro: quer casar rico e fazer carreira á custa da cunha. Para tanto escuda-se numa imagem moralista e preconceituosa mas na realidade é um boémio que gosta de genebra (que bebe em segredo) e de mulheres ( que escolhe num escalão social que não permite o escândalo). Para consolidar a carreira não olha a meios: despreza o pai, corta relações com a madrinha que o educou, representa junto de padre Augusto a encenação de um católico fervoroso, adula a sogra pela qual nutre um ódio profundo, trai o dirigente Cardoso Torres que o levou para a ribalta da política, conseguindo chegar a ministro.
