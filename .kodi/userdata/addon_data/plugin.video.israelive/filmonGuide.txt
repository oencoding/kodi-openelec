After a Back Up activity course, where she abseiled, kayaked, and camped, she realised that she could enjoy life again and regained her confidence and independence. After a stroke which left him paralysed from the neck down, 18-year-old Joe didn't see the point in living, but Back Up put him in touch with a mentor called Matt, who had a similar injury and showed Joe what he could still achieve and encouraged him to go on a Back Up course. The course transformed Joe's life.

In Renaissance Italy 2,000 years later, Galileo Galilei did just that by using the lenses of his simple telescope to reveal our true place in the cosmos. In the 1670s, the Danish astronomer Ole Roemer discovered that light travelled at a finite speed, a discovery that had a profound implication. It meant the further one looks out into the universe, the further one looks back in time. And in 1964, by detecting the cosmic microwave background, the afterglow of the big bang, we captured the oldest light in the universe and saw as far back as its possible to see with light."}, {"start": 1434500700, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvprogramme/282056/e46e32f4af3cff41c7f157d3d006054e.jpg", "end": 1434504300, "name": "Monkey Planet: Family Matters", "description": "Dr George McGavin explores the complex world of primate social lifestyles in this episode of the nature documentary series.

Phaedon begs the fairies to rely on his magic to end the drought. He will need Thalia to assist his magic, by playing her harp. Phaedon’s magic brings on some rain, which turns into a fierce storm that floods the Meadowlands and allows Lord Kann's submarine fleet to invade. Phaedon convinces Thalia and the fairy council that this is her fault. However, Daiman persuades Thalia to trust herself and her own magic abilities. She once again takes up her harp and plays.
